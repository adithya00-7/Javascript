<!-- 
For instance, when fetching http://google.com from http://javascript.info/some/url, the headers look like this: 

Accept: */*
Accept-Charset: utf-8
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Connection: keep-alive
Host: google.com
Origin: http://javascript.info
Referer: http://javascript.info/some/url 

The questions:

Why Origin is needed, if Referer has even more information?
Is it possible that there’s no Referer or Origin, or is it incorrect?

Ans:
We need Origin, because sometimes Referer is absent. For instance, when we fetch HTTP-page from HTTPS (access less secure from more secure), then there’s no Referer.
Exactly because Referer is unreliable, Origin was invented. The browser guarantees correct Origin for cross-origin requests.
